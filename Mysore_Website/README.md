## Project - Mysuru Website
* The cultural ambiance and achievements of Mysuru earned it the sobriquet Cultural Capital of Karnataka. Mysuru is noted for its heritage structures and palaces, including 
the Mysuru Palace, and for the festivities that take place during the Dasara festival when the city receives many tourists from around the world.

* India's tourism sector may lose 4 crore jobs due to COVID-19, a debilitating loss of 5 lakh crore, this is the time where we all have to come together and come up with an innovative and safe way to keep this industry alive!

* So, we have tried to make a website which will attract the tourists and which will help to increase the tourism of Mysore.  We have also tried to connect tourists to local volunteer due to which it will increase the job opportunities.

## Understanding the problems and their solution
* People lack the interaction with the local people due to which they lack the information of the place and find it difficult to find the different places.
* Due to Covid, lots of people have lost their job, so due to which we try to make job opportunities to local people through this platform.
* People have to search different websites for different purposes related to Mysore, so we try to make a single platform where we connect all the information related to Mysore on a single page.
