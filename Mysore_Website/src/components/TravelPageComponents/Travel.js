    <h1>Best Time To visit</h1>
    <p>Mysore's summer hits in March and lasts until June, when daytime temperatures reach around 34 degrees C (93 degrees F). Winters are cooler, with temperatures staying in the 20s from November through to March. </p>
    <p> This is the best period to visit, especially if you wish to avoid the monsoon rains during July to October. During the Dasara celebrations, hotel rooms fill up quickly and prices are hiked, so book ahead if you’re visiting in September/October. It’s a special time to visit, when a range of cultural and musical events are organized that add to the carnival atmosphere.</p>
