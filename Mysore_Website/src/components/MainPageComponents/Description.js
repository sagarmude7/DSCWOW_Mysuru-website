                Famously known as The City of Palaces, it wouldnâ€™t be wrong to say that Mysore, currently Mysuru, is one of the most important places in the country regarding ancient reigns. It is replete with the history of its dazzling royal heritage, intricate architecture, its famed silk sarees, yoga, and sandalwood, to name just a few.
                Located in the foothills of the Chamundi Hills, Mysore is the third most populated city in Karnataka, and its rich heritage draws millions of tourists all year round.
                The highlight is the majestic Mysore Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is a must-visit.<br/><br/>  
                Mysore was one of the three largest Princely States in the erstwhile British Empire of India. To this day, the Mysore Palace stands tall as one of the most spectacular palaces in India.<br/>
                A very famous tourist spot that sees thousands of visitors milling in and around it every day, the Mysore Palace is a mesmerizing example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, every inch of the palace drips with opulence and intricate details, and every room that you visit stands out in terms of its elaborate architecture, beautiful paintings,
                rich colours and stained-glass windows. <br/>On every Sunday, and during the Dussehra celebrations, the palace is spectacularly lit up once dusk falls. Another popular element in Mysore is the Ashtanga School of Yoga. This draws visitors and practitioners from around the world to participate in this style of yoga that originated in Mysore
